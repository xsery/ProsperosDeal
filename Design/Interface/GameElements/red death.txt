Beneath this mask there is more than flesh. Beneath this mask there is the red death.
No one will ever forget that night and what it meant for this country. I must feast on souls.
Do you think you and your court have been forgiven? Do you think you have been forgotten?, Prospero I can save you. Do you wanna live?.
These proving grounds shall be littered with the dead and Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over all .
